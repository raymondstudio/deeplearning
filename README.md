#### A Use Case in Intelligent Configurations Design based on Deep Learning
##### Project Descrption 
Online product configurations are prevailing tools in e-commerce industry to elicit customer needs. Yet current online configurations require customers to specify the choices of each product attribute, which poses a great challenge for customers with no background knowledge.

Hence, this project aims to develop a new online product configuration approach which enables customers to configure a product just by specifying their functional requirements, instead of the detailed design parameters.

For example, when users input the keywords like “a large Screen Size laptop“, our approach could map the associated features and and give high quality recommendations <small>(Fig.1: Our approach to predicting the attributes based on the input “A large Screen Size laptop”)<small>.

##### Solution
We develop tools to extract Amazon user review (laptop) data (suppose these reviews as user inputs). Then we build Deep learning Models to do the query-to-attributes mapping [map user inputs (the functional requirements in unstructured query) into product parameters or features (structured attributes)].

We present this solution in the paper (Mapping Customer Needs in Natural Language to Product Specifications by Using Word Embeddings)[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8JbPdkDj7JZUTRnQnpWQzZnd1k?resourcekey=0-sS9xd_XUXmXHqnk9GfkaXQ]
